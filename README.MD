<h1>CODSOFT-Internship<br>
Projects</h1>
<br>
<p>This repository contains all the projects completed during my CODSOFT C++ Programming Internship.
Each project demonstrates fundamental C++ concepts including classes, functions, loops, condition handling, arrays, and basic logic building.</p>
<h2>Project 1: Simple Calculator</h2>
<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>A basic console-based calculator that performs the following operations:
<ul>
<li>Addition</li>
<li>Subtraction</li>
<li>Multiplication</li>

<h2>PROJECT 2: TO DO LIST</h2>
<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>A console-based To-Do List application written in C++.
It allows users to manage their daily tasks with features like:
<ul>
<li>Add a new task</li>
<li>View all tasks</li>
<li>Mark task as completed</li>
<li>Remove a task</li>
<li>Display task status (Completed / Pending)</li>
</ul>
The project focuses on vectors, loops, functions, and basic data handling.</p>
